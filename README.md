Why Donuts?
------------
Have you wonder, why wordpress is so slow but many of we coders need to stock with it like the IT newbies？   
We don't like Wordpress, we knew it is the brainless and quick way to setup your CMS.
But, it's UGLY and NOT designed for advanced users like hackers and programmers.   
We decided to make a difference by bake our own CMS using CakePHP.   

Why CakePHP?
------------
CakePHP is a well-designed full-stack framework.

Why PHP?
--------

The LAMP solution is also so popular that EVERY VPS or Web Host or Cloud support the crap out it;)
