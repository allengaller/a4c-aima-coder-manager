This project covers the Linux server side, Mac/iOS/Android Client side, and of crouse the Web version.   
The current on-going development is mainly focus on the Linux server side and the web version of Brownie.   

Why Brownie?
------------
Have you wonder, why wordpress is so slow but many of we coders need to stock with it like the IT newbies？   
We don't like Wordpress, we knew it is the brainless and quick way to setup your CMS.
But, it's UGLY and NOT designed for advanced users like hackers and programmers.   
We decided to make a difference by bake our own CMS using CakePHP.   

Why CakePHP?
------------
CakePHP is a well-designed full-stack framework.

Why PHP?
--------
PHP is the most popular web programming languages in the real world, and also the server world.   
The LAMP solution is also so popular that EVERY VPS or Web Host or Cloud support the crap out it;)   

OK, Features?
-------------
* Self-host or host by Apps4Coder. Your data matters.

* Full-stack CMS system. We intend to build-in everything you ever gonna need for a CMS system.
